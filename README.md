Code used in my Senior Design project.

# rmds-strip files
These scripts are used to scrape project-relevant data from RMDS log files.
rmds-strip is the most basic version, made to work with specific test data.
rmds-strip-mp implemented Multiprocessing, and a way to spoof input to test performance.
rmds-strip-mp-2 changed the scrape logic to fit differently-formatted log files that we got later.

# flaskSpace
This (will be) where the Flask code is placed.
